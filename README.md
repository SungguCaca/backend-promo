# backend-promo
 <p>to build a food and beverage service that can manage food items, set promotions, and allow users to list all available food items.
 For a single service architecture, we can use a monolithic architecture that contains all necessary components, while for a scalable service architecture.
 we can use a microservices architecture that separates the food and promotion management into two separate services.</p>
 
 <p>Both services use Node.js and Express.js, while the food service can connect to a MongoDB database, and the promotion service can use Redis to store information about the promotion.</p>
 
<p>Port : 8000</p>
<p>Database : MongoDB</p>
<p>Run : 'node app'</p>
<p>Run test : 'npm test' or 'npm test -- --watch'</p>
